We used R extensively to cleanse, conform and visualize the data. We also built a Shiny application for this dataset. Our main focus in this application was to tell a story on how number of gun violence incidents are changing. 

We found some very interesting insights from the data like the number of gun violences are higher over the weekends and it is also higher during the summer.

We also used line graphs, geographical mapping, word cloud to show differnt attributes of the dataset.

We built a forecasting model to predict the number of possible victims due to gun violence in the following year.
